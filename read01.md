Readings: APIs and SDK 
Explain what the APIs are by answering the following questions: 
1.	Explain API types
2.	Explain the benefits of APIs
3.	Analyze the differences between API and SDK
<br><br><br>
## Explain API types [1]
There are 4 types of APIs:
1. Public API: which means that any developer or business can have access on this type of API because it’s open for everyone. Public APIs are used when a company wants to share its applications and data with other businesses.
<br><br>
2. Partner API: it’s a tool used to facilitate business-to-business activities and only a small number of outside developers or API customers have access to it.
<br><br>

3. Internal (private) API: this type of API is designed only to be used within the enterprise to connect systems and data. Because internal APIs are designed for internal usage, they present weak security and authentication but this is changing as companies are now more interested in learning about threat awareness 
<br><br>
4.	Composite API: Composite APIs are made up of two or more APIs to provide a sequence of linked or interdependent activities. Composite APIs are effective for handling API behaviors that are complex or closely related.

<br><br><br>

## Explain the benefits of APIs [2]
<br><br>
1. Increases productivity
APIs are a valuable tool for accelerating development. Instead of designing solutions from the ground up, developers can use APIs to swiftly apply existing functionality.
<br><br>
2. Saves costs
The ability to save money is one of the most significant advantages of APIs for businesses. Using APIs to construct applications is a wonderful method to cut expenses because they greatly reduce development work.
<br><br>
3. Improves connectivity and collaboration
Private APIs, often known as internal APIs, can help businesses increase cooperation and internal communication. APIs enable disparate systems, applications, and platforms to communicate and share data, as well as perform a variety of operations.
<br><br>
4. Enhances customer experience
Enterprises may establish innovative and effective ways of communicating with customers by leveraging APIs' capabilities, especially in the present digital age when consumers demand top-notch experiences.
<br><br>
5. Collects data for intelligence analytics
Enterprises may provide an easy and rapid approach to extract value from data by leveraging APIs. You can track and analyze how third-party developers use APIs by establishing them and releasing them to the public. This gives you valuable information on how customers engage with your items.

## Analyze the differences between API and SDK [3]
<br><br>
What is a software development kit (SDK)?
It is a set of software-development tools for a certain platform, which often includes building blocks, debuggers, and a framework or group of code libraries, such as a set of operating system-specific functions (OS). <br><br><br>
Some or all of these resources may be included in a typical SDK's collection of tools:
- Compiler
- Code samples
- Code libraries (framework)
- Testing and analytics tools
- Documentation
- Debuggers
- At least one API is frequently provided in the SDK since without it, applications cannot exchange data or collaborate.
<br><br>
What is an API?[4]
It is a software interface that enables two apps to communicate with one another. You utilize an API every time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone.
<br><br><br>
An API can be made up of two parts:
<br><br>
-Technical specs and documentation: This material describes how to use the API efficiently by integrating it.
<br><br>
-The interface itself: In the case of a web API, you can access it directly through keyword or indirectly via a separate interface (in the case of a REST API).

<br><br><br>

The difference between them briefly [5]

An API is a collection of libraries that make up the core language and can be used right away, whereas an SDK is a development kit that makes it easier to use an API. Both are, in theory, ways for your application to communicate with and control resources offered by another piece of software.
